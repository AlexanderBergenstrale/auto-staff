# auto-staff
I have an idea for creating an automated solution for securing temporary staffing when required. The premise being that this task is manual today, error prone and time consuming even today.
When the care system is overwhelmed and existing staff must quickly be replaced or augmented, an automated system would be able to fill in open positions more quickly than someone manually calling around.
The solution would include a personnel registry, an hierarchical decision structure, an administrative UI for configuration and reporting, frontends for end users and backend services for automation etc.
As an example, a staffing responsible registers the organization, its structure and staffing positions. Invites staffing including the staffing pool. Everyone accepts and register.
Whenever a staffing need occurs, anyone can trigger a staffing fulfillment action, either reporting in sick or manually triggering an event. The system automatically reaches out to potential staffers who actively opts in. This can be achieved through apps, IVRs or manually.
This idea is quite modular and achievable. It can be adapted to fit most cases where there is a benefit for quickly securing staff.
Iâ€™m want to create a team to conceptualize and prototype. Calling out to UX, service designers, researchers and doers who can develop API-first. Hopeful to get started and ideate around this
